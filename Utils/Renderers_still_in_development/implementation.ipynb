    "# Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned before, the main objective of this project is to implement an easy to use fractal renderer for educational purposes. The created tool lets user experiment with mentioned sets and study their behavior in an intuitive visual way. This visual representation of such sets stands out as a particularly intriguing aspect. Boundaries of Julia sets and related ones seem to take an amazingly natural and organic shapes, potentially prompting the reader to a deeper exploration of epistemological Platonism within the realm of mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when it comes to implementing most mathematical concepts numerically it's necessary to approximate the solution.\n",
    "To visualize those sets will map their orbits to the color space. This will allow us to see the structure of the set. The mapping uses the number of iterations it took for the orbit to escape the circle of a given radius. The color of the pixel is then determined by the number of iterations it took the orbit to escape the given radius. In addition we will approximate the convergence of the orbit by calculating an arbitrary number of iterations, a value derived through meticulous testing of numerical effectiveness and optimization (in most cases set at 256, as it provides adequate results and allows for the utilization of the uint8 datatype in most cases).\n",
    "Why is such approximation is valid? We can present it by simplifying the problem to a much more intuitive space R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating function f(x_k) = x_k-1^2, where x e R will showcase the behavior of orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For values of x more than 1, the orbit will escape to infinity.\n",
    "For x=1 the orbit will stay at 1.\n",
    "For x between -1 and 1 the orbit will converge to 0.\n",
    "For x less than -1 the orbit will also escape to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we can call 0 and 1 fixed points of our iterative function. The point 0 is identified as an attractive fixed point, due to the fact that orbits starting in its vicinity converge towards it. Point 1 is a repulsive fixed point, owing to the fact that orbits around it diverge from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values in the interval[-1,1] will not escape to infinity and thus constitute our set. In contrast values outside of this interval generate unbounded orbits, and are thus not included in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior seems intuitively justified by recognizing that 1 is an identity element for multiplication over R, and so it's natural for orbits to maintain their stationary state at 1. The operation of squearing (that is multiplication of a number by itself) ensures that values below 0 will be mirrored after the initial iteration to the positive side of the number line, so we can expect similar behavior to positive numbers, after the first iteration. Finally value of 0 being less than 1 (and to -1 in the mirrored domain), is anticipated to attract nearby orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is very straightforward, so let's introduce complexity by modifying to our function. Now we can set our function to be f(x) = x^2 - 1. This small adjustment can provide us with examples of more interesting orbit behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For x=1 the orbit will transition from f(1) = 0 to f(0) = -1 and returning to f(-1) = 0. Such orbit is called periodic.\n",
    "Orbits  initializing between -1 and 1 are incorporated in our set. Moreover orbits starting in proximity of this interval tend to fall into it during initial iterations, thus being included in the set as well.\n",
    "Many orbits will exhibit seemingly chaotic behavior before stabilizing. For instance, starting from 0.5, the sequence progresses as follows: -0.75 -> -0.4375 -> -0.808594 -> -0.346176 -> -0.880162 ->  -0.225315 -> -0.949233 -> -0.0989567 ->  -0.990208 ->  -0.0194881 -> -0.99962 -> -0.000759856 -> -0.999999 and so on. Initially the orbit appears chaotic, but in the limit it stabilizes as a periodically stable orbit oscillating between 0 and -1.\n",
    "Simple subtraction of 1 from the previous function has made orbit's behavior far more complex. Extending this analysis from the real axis to the complex plane and broadening our function f(x) to whole family of iterative functions f(z_k) = z_k-1^2 + c, where z is a complex variable and c is a complex constant, we can find infinitely inticate behavior of orbits. Plotting them as a color map will allow us to see the structure of those unimaginably complex sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we observed in simpler examples, the divergence of orbits originating at points equal or beyond 1 from the origin of real axis is intuitively anticipated and this expectation is readily justified. This principle seamlessly extends to the complex plane. It is proven, that for orbits exceeding a radius of 2 it is guaranteed to diverge to infinity. It is noteworthy that if we adjust our definition of Julia sets to include trigonometric functions, exemplified by f(z_k) = sin(z_k-1)*c, the radius of divergence will need to be adjusted. \n"

    "## Basic renderer\n",
    "Armed with the knowledge gained we can now proceed to implement the fractal renderer. Following libraries will be essential to utilize:\n",

    "Additionally few other libraries are employed for final renderer. However the scope of this paper will be centered around explaining basic functionality of renderer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical component to begin with is building a function computing the orbits for a given sympy function, this is crucial for determining membership in Julia set. For that we'll need to initialize several constants:\n",

    "re_min, re_max, im_min, im_max = -2, 2, -2, 2 # complex plane range to be rendered\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Visual analisis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have developed a tool capable of rendering a visual representations of Julia sets, we can conduct visual analysis of these mathematical entities.\n",
    "A key observation to start from is that varying `const` argument yields different fractal patterns. For instance:\n",

    "const = 0.285 + 0.01j: render_2\n",

    "Furthermore it's noteworthy that in the vicinity of the Mandelbrot set's boundary we can find most visually intricate patterns of Julia sets. \n",
    "This observation stems from the relationship between the two explained earlier. The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterative function, that takes `z=0` as a starting argument and varying the `const` value. Hence, for a given `const` value the orbit of Julia set is the same as for Mandelbrot set. Consequently for values inside the Mandelbrot set Julia sets won't be as visually stimulating as near it's boundary. The impression will be similar for values distant from the Mandelbrot set's boundary:\n",

    "One last thing I wanted to mention in this paper is the dimensionality of fractals. When it comes to these unusual mathematical entities it starts to make sense to talk about fractional dimensions (Minkowski-Bouligand dimension, Hausdorff dimension, etc,..). At first glance the notion of fractional dimensions may seem perplexing, yet it will become more coherent after short explanation. These shapes, as our examples have shown, can exhibit infinitely intricate boundary and so have an infinite length in a finite area, essentially bridging the gap between conventional dimensions. It can be achived by staying irregular at arbitrary scale. This behavior can be seen on the file below:\n",

    "It is our  sincere hope that this exploration of the mesmerizing world of fractals was as engaging and as captivating for the reader as for the authors of this paper. For those whose curiosity remains unquenched, we will end this paper with few more examples of those marvellous visuals and leave the reader with tools to dive deeper into the realm of fractals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a codebase with a comprehensive suite of tools designed for fractal generation, with different parameters to experiment with. The repository is an ongoing project and gets updates on a weekly basis, but it already contains a rich collection of functionalities. From color mapping's operations to creating visuals based on trigonometric functions and vastly more. We wholeheartedly encourage the reader to pause and dive into the creative process of fractal exploration.\n",

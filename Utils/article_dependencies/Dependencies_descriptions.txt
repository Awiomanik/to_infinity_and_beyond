(render of z^2 -1 function to be attached to a proper parragraph)

function: 			f(z_k) = z_k-1^2 - 1
range:				-2 to 2 and -1i to i
calculated iterations:		256
magnitude of divergence:	50
rsolution: 			5000 x 2500 px
Note:
Values of indicating divergance where subjected to the fourth root operation 
and mapped with linear mapping function "gist_heat" from matplotlib standard module
for clear and vivid representation of the set.

(nice render for a title page)

function: 			f(z_k) = z_k-1^2 -0.8 + 0.156i
range:				-0.016 to 0.016 and -0.009i to 0.009i
calculated iterations:		256
magnitude of divergence:	2
rsolution: 			6400 x 3600 px


graphic_3.png
(mandelbrot set)

function: 			f(z_k) = z_k-1^2 + complex_coordinate
range:				-2.2 to 0.8 and -1.5i to 1.5i
calculated iterations:		256
magnitude of divergence:	4
rsolution: 			10000 x 10000 px
Note:
Values of indicating divergance where subjected to the fourth root operation 
and values of 0 were casted to 1 for clear and vivid representation.

(Mandelbrot self-similarity zoom)

function: 			f(z_k) = z_k-1^2 + complex_coordinate
range:				from (-2.2 to 0.8 and -1.5i to 1.5i) to (-1.51755 to -1.51745 and -0.00005i to 0.00005i)
calculated iterations:		256
magnitude of divergence:	2
rsolution: 			1080 x 1080 px
Frames:				300
Frame duration:			50 ms
Note:
Zooming reduces range on logarythmic scale with base 2000

(Julia sets for chaos paragraph)

function: 			f(z_k) = z_k-1^2 + complex_coordinate
range:				-2 to 2 and -2i to 2i
calculated iterations:		256
magnitude of divergence:	2
rsolution: 			800 x 800 px
Note:
complex_coordinate value ranges from -1 to 1

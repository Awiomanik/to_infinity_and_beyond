## Usage:

It is highly recommended to begin your journey with this repository by familiarizing yourself with the paper titled ["Holomorphic Dynamics: An Odyssey from Chaos to Art"](Holomorphic_dynamics_an_Odyssey_from_Chaos_to_Art.pdf).

The repository also contains a tool for exploring fractals on your own: [Rendering tool (shell script)](Rendering_tool.py). Witness beauty of mathematics first-hand.

Furthermore, users are encouraged to peruse the files contained within this repository. Among these are example renders and files containing tools that are not yet ready for production. These developmental tools offer the potential for generating even more captivating fractal visualizations.

<!--
- **[Complex_plotter.py](Complex_plotter.py)**<br>
In the directory of plotter run the console command:<br>
`python script_name.py [plane_range1] [plane_range2] [plane_range3] [plane_range4] [constant_coefficient]`<br>
**Parameters:**<br>
`plane_range`: A tuple indicating the range of the complex plane to be plotted ($R_{min}, R_{max}, I_{min}, I_{max}$).<br>
`constant_coefficient`: The coefficient for the fractal attractor.
$$a(z) = z^{2} + constant\_coefficiant$$

## Features
> **edit later

- Interactive Python notebooks for learning about various fractal sets, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and more.
- An interactive user interface for dynamically exploring different fractal patterns.
- Options for customizing parameters to generate unique fractal shapes.
- Lots of fractals ;)

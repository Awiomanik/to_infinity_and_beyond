# To infinity and beyond
> **still in development**

This repository contains a collection of fractal algorithms and visualization tools aimed at exploring the fascinating world of fractals, developed as a learning endeavour to deepen my understanding of both programming and complex mathematical concepts.

Explore various fractals with Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. This project is aimed at learning coding and exploring math.
